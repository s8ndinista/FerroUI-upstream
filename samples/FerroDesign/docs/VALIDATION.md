# Validation and measurements

This file distinguishes commands that have passed from checks that are still in progress. It will be updated with the completed browser run and its artifacts.

## Observed results

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Core unit tests | 79 passed: existing document/SVG/layout coverage plus vector-edit, Unicode text-range, prototype timing/key/overlay, isolated-root hit testing and interaction-authoring regressions |
| Native full application check | Passed on Linux, Rust 1.99.0, with `--lib --tests`; compiled the XAML shell, native text/paint editors, prototype runtime and test targets |
| FerroUI browser bridge TypeScript check/build | Passed |
| Browser text-input event regressions | 8 passed with Node, bundling the actual TypeScript bridge; includes Unicode insertion, composition deduplication and listener cleanup |
| Browser host JavaScript and shell syntax | Passed |
| Browser persistence host tests | 13 passed with Node |
| Actual IndexedDB transactions in Chromium | All 5 checks passed, including atomic migration, rollback, stale-tab conflicts and reload of a 12,000,042-character document |
| Native atomic-save tests | 2 passed in the standalone host harness |
| Active browser dependency graph | No `ferroui-skia`, `skia-safe` or `skia-bindings` |
| Actual WebAssembly application build | Passed with the pinned Emscripten toolchain, including linking and optimization; all six required JavaScript modules verified in the distribution |
| Browser pixels and editing interactions | [CI run 39152600835](https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/FerroUI/actions/runs/39152600835) built the actual WASM app; Software2D and real WebGL2 each passed 12 checks, then found a native text-input failure. The bridge fix is awaiting a new complete browser run. |
| macOS/Windows native runtime | Not run in this environment |
| Exact Figma visual parity | Not measured |

The final local browser distribution contains 16 files totaling 48,616,131 bytes. Its WebAssembly module is 47,950,030 bytes before HTTP compression. All browser host sources match their packaged counterparts, including the IndexedDB storage module. These packaging checks establish that the application is buildable and its imports are complete; rendered behavior is checked separately in Chromium.

The first CI browser run found that text inserted without a keydown updated only the hidden DOM input. FerroUI's browser bridge now forwards non-composing `insertText` payloads through the native text event, preserving native selection and resynchronizing the DOM after the native control finishes its edit. Composition input remains owned by the composition handlers, with a bounded duplicate-commit guard. This is a targeted text-insertion fix; browser autocorrect replacement ranges and input-only deletion are not newly implemented by this patch. The original multiline Unicode assertions remain in place.

## Document-engine benchmark

The release benchmark creates 10,000 editable nodes, builds the spatial scene, issues point/viewport queries, performs 120 incremental drag updates and measures transaction history. Values below are actual measurements in the development container; they are not browser FPS, GPU measurements or hardware-independent guarantees.

| Operation | Measured result |
| --- | ---: |
| Point hit query, average over 10,000 queries | 3.192 microseconds |
| Viewport query, average | 76.997 microseconds |
| Incremental drag refresh, median | 5.658 milliseconds |
| Incremental drag refresh, p95 | 7.623 milliseconds |
| Transaction commit | 11.944 milliseconds |
| Undo | 4.707 milliseconds |
| Redo | 5.251 milliseconds |

This run created 10,000 nodes in 12.354 ms and built the initial index in 21.735 ms. It ran concurrently with the WebAssembly compiler. These are current container CPU/model timings; there is no same-run baseline for calculating a speedup and no browser-FPS claim. Correctness tests compare incremental state against full rebuilds, including clipped transformed subtrees, stacking changes and history.

Reproduce the workload from the sample directory:

```sh
cargo run --release -p ferrodesign-core --example performance -- 10000
```

## What the browser test verifies

`tests/browser.mjs` launches the actual application at a 1600 by 1000 viewport in two contexts, requesting Software2D and WebGL2. It records the observed canvas context and allows the documented WebGL2-to-Software2D fallback. The CI browser may use SwiftShader; its results establish functional rendering, not real GPU throughput.

The test waits for a completed native frame and dismissal of the loading surface, inspects native pixel diversity, draws a rectangle, edits vector anchors and pen tangents, edits multiline Unicode in the native on-canvas TextBox, changes paints through the native dialog, and dispatches prototype hover/press/drag/key/delay actions. It checks one-transaction history, canceled text edits, UTF-8 rich-run ranges, JSON import/export equality, durable reload, and bounded virtualized rows with a 10,000-layer document larger than 5 MiB. The separate IndexedDB browser test uses actual transactions for migration, rollback, stale-tab conflicts and a document larger than 10 MiB. The application browser test also collects console exceptions, startup failures and FerroUI render-thread panics. Its screenshots, Playwright traces and report are written under `browser-report` and uploaded by GitHub Actions.

An interaction test is evidence for those paths, not for every item in the feature inventory. There is no same-document image comparison to a Figma reference screenshot. Browser rendering timings and memory should be measured on the intended deployment devices before establishing a frame-rate or capacity target.

## Browser QA environment

The connected local browser cannot reach the build container loopback server. The supported managed preview supervisor also fails during its process-mount setup (`bwrap: Cannot mount proc`), including the permitted escalated attempt. No replacement browser-control mechanism is used. Browser interaction evidence for this revision must come from the repository CI workflow and its rendered screenshots/reports; a successful native compile does not establish browser interaction success.
